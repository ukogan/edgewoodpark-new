Someone doing the work who can help others do it too. I teach teams to use agentic engineering, help product and engineering collaborate as AI shifts roles, and advise on applied AI product strategy.

## Agentic Engineering Coaching

Teach teams to use AI tools to move faster and be more customer-centric. Not prompt engineering -- product engineering with AI as a collaborator.

## Eng/Product Collaboration

Help engineering and product teams collaborate better as AI shifts traditional role boundaries. Who builds what, when, and why.

## Applied AI Product Strategy

Helping companies figure out how to use AI to solve their specific business problems. Not generic "add AI" advice -- analysis of your competitive landscape, your customers, your constraints.
