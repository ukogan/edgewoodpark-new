# Top Tech Company HQ -- ODCV Commissioning & M&V

Comprehensive validation of complexity: 103 heterogeneous BACnet metrics across 7 groups, 3 independent detectors (flatlining, gap, range), composite health scoring system, configurable thresholds per metric type.

**Architecture driven by data model:** The campus equipment was heterogeneous -- 103 different metrics needing completely different validation logic. This meant a wide, configurable detection engine with per-metric-type thresholds and composite scoring.

## Before

Built initially to validate only operating hours when ODCV was active. Assumed off-hours were not relevant. BMS was delivering 17,700 CFM continuously -- over 3x the ASHRAE 62.1 code requirement at full design occupancy.

## After

Expanded data aperture after seeing odd pre-hours behavior. Discovered nights and weekends systems running as if occupied 24/7. 90% OA reduction achieved (96% on weekends). A configuration error that had been bleeding money invisibly.

## Outcome

27% building-level energy reduction. 4.58 metric tons CO2 avoided. Zero comfort complaints. Customer now considering expansion across their entire campus and other campuses worldwide. Same PM, same domain, radically different architecture than the hospital -- because the data model demanded it.
