# Voice-of-customer intelligence pipeline

Originally built for Product to systematically understand customer objections and feature requests from sales calls. 5-stage ETL: ingestion, speaker classification, transcript enrichment, insight extraction, structured output. 11 configuration sheet types for customizable analysis.

**Cross-functional adoption:** Marketing adopted it as a key input for ABM content generation -- turning real customer objections expressed on calls into targeted content addressing those exact concerns. Became critical infrastructure for understanding VOC across the organization.

## Outcome

Product insight + marketing content from the same pipeline. VOC at scale.
