# Multi-agent competitive intelligence platform

Built rich competitive profiles, battlecards, and comparison matrices. Shared with sales. Their biggest feedback: "How can I use this to respond to a prospect on a call?" Built a chatbot on the validated knowledge corpus covering dozens of competitors.

**Sequence mattered:** If the chatbot came first, the knowledge corpus and data validation system wouldn't exist. Built an eval system to ensure the chatbot was generating good answers. Discovered the agent was sometimes answering with information beyond its scope -- tightened instructions to enforce boundaries.

## Outcome

CEO Alex called it "great potential to accelerate our strategic and GTM efforts."
