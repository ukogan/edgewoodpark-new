subtitle: Product leader who builds to discover

## Diff

- Old way: Define requirements, hand to engineering, wait
+ New way: Build working software -> real customer evidence -> proven requirements

+ Built for facilities engineers, sold to CFOs, led marketers, managed suppliers, transformed organizations. I understand buyer behavior across many contexts, because I've lived in them.
+ Consulting, product marketing, marketing leadership, product management. Operating range to think about where the industry is going, where the customer is headed, where they are now, and build the software that gets them there.
+ Building quickly is how you discover a great product, if you have taste. Mine comes from serving enough different buyers to know what actually gets adopted.
