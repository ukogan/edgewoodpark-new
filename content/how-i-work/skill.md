# How I Work

Product management is about three things: a product customers love,
that your team can deliver, that makes your company successful.
AI has given us a powerful new tool, but the job hasn't changed.

## Patterns

Practices I've found most effective across 15+ years of product leadership:

- **Customer Intimacy** -- Ongoing customer relationships, not one-time
  research phases. Decades of B2B GTM across every side of the table.

- **Cross-Functional Leadership** -- Do whatever the business needs.
  Fill gaps. Remove blockers. Translate between worlds.

- **Build to Discover** -- Build working software before committing
  engineering time. Working software surfaces what planning never could.

- **From Business Strategy to Shipping Code** -- Analyze the market
  AND build the product. No handoff required.

- **Engineering Collaboration** -- PM builds customer evidence that
  de-risks engineering investment.

- **Trust as the Product** -- If the user doesn't trust the system,
  the system doesn't matter.

## Antipatterns

Mistakes I've made and what they taught me:

- **The MVP Trap** -- Built a data dashboard as the "logical first
  step." It was neither easy nor useful.
