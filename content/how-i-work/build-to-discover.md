# Build to Discover

## The Method

Agentic engineering: validate hypotheses with working tools, not
throwaway prototypes. Tools that serve real pilot customers and
generate real evidence.

## Discovery: Premier Children's Hospital

Built a data validation tool expecting to find missing occupancy
data. Instead, discovered the vendor's incorrect SOO implementation
-- timing delays (15min occupied-to-standby, 5min standby-to-occupied)
were completely missing. 10-15% energy savings left on the table.
Customer trust shifted from their MSI to us.

## Discovery: Top Tech Company HQ

Built a commissioning dashboard scoped to operating hours. Expanded
the data aperture and discovered nights/weekends systems running as
if occupied 24/7. A configuration error bleeding money invisibly.
A bigger opportunity than the original scope.

## Why This Matters

Both discoveries happened because working software was in front of
real data. No spec, wireframe, or interview would have surfaced
these -- the gap between assumption and reality only becomes visible
when you build.
