# The MVP Trap

## What Happened

Built an IAQ data dashboard as the "logical first step" toward
delivering insights. We already knew from customers and sales that
insights were the endgame. The mistake: assuming raw telemetry was
the natural first milestone.

## Why It Failed

Customers don't want minute-by-minute VOC readings on the 14th
floor. They want to know: "Is my building comfortable? Where are
the problem spots? If I'm getting complaints, are they warranted?"

The dashboard was neither easy (substantial engineering work to
build) nor useful (customers didn't engage with it).

## The Right MVP

The simplest useful insight. Not raw telemetry. Not a replica of
what the hardware vendor already provides. The one piece of
actionable information that proves the concept is worth pursuing.

## The Painful Part

My head of product was a Cagan-school disciple who preached exactly
this -- validate before you build, know your customer, make sure
every bet is high-conviction. We both knew the principle. We fell
into the trap anyway.

## The Lesson

Every yes has to be high-conviction. Knowing the principle isn't
enough -- you have to *feel* the cost of violating it. This failure
is useful because it hurts to recall. It makes every subsequent
product decision more careful.
