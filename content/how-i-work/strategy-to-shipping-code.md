# From Business Strategy to Shipping Code

## Zooming Out

Competitive positioning at the business model level. Where are
incumbents structurally constrained? Build strategy around what
they *can't* do -- not what they *haven't* done.

Example: every major BMS vendor claims to build "the intelligence
layer for buildings." But their business models prevent neutrality
-- Honeywell will never tell a customer to replace Honeywell
equipment. The opportunity is vendor-neutral intelligence on
existing infrastructure.

## Zooming In

Working software, customer-specific data discoveries, architecture
driven by the customer's reality -- not a template.

Same PM, same domain, same "HVAC data validation" goal -- but
radically different architectures at the children's hospital
(homogeneous zones: same rule applied across 100+ VAVs) versus
the tech company HQ (heterogeneous equipment: 103 different metrics
needing different validation logic). The customer's data model
drives the architecture, not a reusable framework.
