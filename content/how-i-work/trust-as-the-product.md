# Trust as the Product

## Three Principles

### 1. Don't collect what you don't need

*Retirement Advisor* -- PII stripping as trust design, not just
security. What matters is the context of someone's financial
situation, not their identity. Especially for older users wary of
uploading private information to a website. Strip what's unnecessary,
earn trust.

### 2. Verify AI output systematically

*Competition Bot* -- Source verification: agents check facts against
original sources. Eval system: systematic testing of chatbot answers
against known-good responses. Scope enforcement: discovered the agent
was answering questions beyond its knowledge base, tightened
instructions. The instinct to constrain AI to be reliably useful
rather than impressively wrong.

### 3. Keep humans in control

*ODCV* -- Not making AI recommendations. Implementing customer-approved
sequences based on recognized national and international standards.
The customer is always in control. They approve what we do in advance.
Kill switch always available. AI informs, humans decide.

## The Common Thread

Whether it's a senior citizen managing retirement finances, a sales
rep using competitive intelligence, or a facility manager controlling
HVAC -- if the user doesn't trust the system, the system doesn't
matter. Trust isn't a feature. It's the product.
