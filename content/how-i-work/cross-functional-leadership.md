# Cross-Functional Leadership

## In Practice (2025)

A single quarter at R-Zero:

- Became the **ODCV domain expert** when no one else would step up
- Led **marketing through a leadership vacuum** while simultaneously
  shipping PM deliverables
- Built **customer-facing tools** when engineering was focused on
  infrastructure and data pipelines
- Took the company's **most important strategic initiative** from
  theory to deployment to proof of value

CEO strategy sessions, sales enablement tools, engineering handoffs
with proven requirements -- all in the same quarter.

## The Principle

Product management isn't a lane. It's a commitment to making the
product and the business successful by whatever means necessary.
Sometimes that means writing a PRD. Sometimes it means building a
prototype. Sometimes it means running marketing while the team finds
a new CMO.
