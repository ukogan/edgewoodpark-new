# Customer Intimacy

## The Approach

Build, ship, observe, expand. Customer understanding isn't something you
do once and move on from -- it compounds over time as you build tools,
watch how they're used, and expand what you learn into the next iteration.

## Why GTM Background Matters

I've spent decades on every side of the B2B table:

- Selling to **CFOs** evaluating ROI models
- Building tools for **facilities engineers** with clipboards and five
  blinking monitors
- Working with **AP clerks** processing invoices
- Supporting **marketers** managing creative supply chains
- Advising **commercial real estate** portfolio managers

15+ persona types across 20 years. That GTM background means
understanding not just what users need, but how buyers evaluate,
how sellers sell, how deals close.

## Evidence

The vendor timing errors at a premier children's hospital and the
24/7 HVAC waste at a top tech company HQ -- these weren't discovered
through surveys or interviews. They were discovered by building tools
and looking at real data alongside customers who trusted us enough to
give us access.
