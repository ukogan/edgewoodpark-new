# Hero Page Rewrite (v3)

## Proposed Version

```markdown
---
name: Uri Kogan
subtitle: Product leader who builds to discover
---

## Diff

- Old way: Define requirements, hand to engineering, wait
+ New way: Build working software -> real customer evidence -> proven requirements

+ Built for facilities engineers, sold to CFOs, led marketers, managed suppliers, transformed organizations. I understand buyer behavior across many contexts, because I've lived in them.
+ Consulting, product marketing, marketing leadership, product management. Operating range to think about where the industry is going, where the customer is headed, where they are now, and build the software that gets them there.
+ Building quickly is how you discover a great product, if you have taste. Mine comes from having shipped to enough different buyers to know what actually gets adopted.

## Stats

- 4 / Zero-to-one products
- 2 / Successful exits
- 15+ / Years product leadership
- 5 / VP+ roles

## Changes from v2

### Line 1: Uri's version, near-verbatim

"Built for facilities engineers, sold to CFOs, led marketers, managed suppliers, transformed organizations. I understand buyer behavior across many contexts, because I've lived in them."

This is stronger than the v2 draft. "Transformed organizations" adds the consulting dimension. "Because I've lived in them" is more personal and earned than "every side of the table."

### Line 2: Operating range + adapted interview quote

Combines three things tightly:
1. Career arc as a comma-separated list (no "from...to...to" construction, just the list)
2. "Operating range" as the bridge concept
3. Uri's interview quote ("I am a strategist who can think about where the industry is going, where our customer is going, where they are now...") adapted to end with building software instead of "how do we help them do their job better tomorrow"

The progression zooms from macro to hands-on: industry direction, customer direction, customer present state, build the thing. Each element is a level of altitude, and the sentence itself demonstrates the range it describes.

### Line 3: Taste sharpened

"Mine comes from having shipped to enough different buyers to know what actually gets adopted."

Replaces the flabby "twenty years of learning how all those different buyers actually work" with a specific claim: the measure of taste isn't aesthetic judgment, it's knowing what will actually get adopted. "Shipped to" is more concrete than "learned from." The sentence is tight enough that it doesn't need to re-enumerate the buyer types from line 1.
