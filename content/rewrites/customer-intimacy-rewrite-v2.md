# Customer Intimacy

Customer understanding compounds. It's not a research phase
you complete and move on from; it's an ongoing relationship where
every engagement expands what you know about the next one.

## Your sources are confident and wrong

Every persona knows their piece of the system, and they'll describe
it with authority. But their knowledge has gaps they don't see. At
one customer site, I built a plan around a facility manager's
confident description of the system. He was wrong, and I had to
learn the hard way to triangulate: gather from every available
source, cross-reference for inconsistencies, and confirm the
critical details before committing.

## Put the product in the real world early

I PM'd an on-device ML occupancy sensor through pilot deployment
with three major enterprises. The things customers surfaced
(cross-traffic in hallways, subdividing rooms that break count
assumptions, winter sunlight degrading sensors, solid doors causing
missed counts) were invisible until hardware was in real buildings
with real users testing it.

Most useful: 90% accuracy is statistically sufficient, but when a
user walks under a sensor ten times and it misses one, it feels
broken. I solved the accuracy-vs-battery tradeoff by reframing
requirements and moving edge cases to cloud post-processing instead
of pushing the on-device model.

## Follow curiosity beyond the spec

At a top tech company HQ, I built a dashboard scoped to operating
hours but noticed odd behavior before the building opened. I
expanded the data aperture and found the HVAC running 24/7 as if
fully occupied. A bigger opportunity than the original scope, found
because I was curious, not because anyone asked.

## What's different from v1

v1 told a building technology story. v2 leads with three PM principles about customer engagement:

1. **Triangulate your sources** (don't trust confident informants)
2. **Real-world deployment reveals what planning can't** (the sensor story as evidence of getting product in front of customers early)
3. **Follow curiosity beyond the scope** (the discovery mindset)

The stories are compressed to 2-3 sentences each, serving as proof of the principle, not the content itself. A hiring manager scanning sees three customer engagement skills with specific evidence for each.

## Blog post

The blog post version from v1 still works as the linked long-form narrative. The story framing is fine there because blog readers are choosing to go deep.
