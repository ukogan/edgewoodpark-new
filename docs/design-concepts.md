# Website Design Concepts

5 approaches that signal "builds with Claude Code" - not just as content, but as design language.

---

## 1. The Live Session

The site *is* a Claude Code session. Visitors see a terminal-style interface where content appears as if being generated in real-time.

### Key Elements
- Monospace typography, dark mode by default
- Content "types out" with subtle animation (skippable)
- Project descriptions appear as conversation turns: your prompt → Claude's response → your refinement
- Actual code snippets from projects visible in collapsed `<details>` blocks
- "View the conversation that built this" links to annotated transcripts

### Why It Signals Sophistication
You're not hiding the process; you're showcasing it. Shows you understand the tool deeply enough to make it the medium.

## 2. The Diff View

Every section shows transformation: before/after, problem/solution, prompt/output. The visual language of version control and iterative refinement.

### Key Elements
- Split-pane layouts throughout (side-by-side comparisons)
- Red/green diff styling for key transitions in career or projects
- Projects show: "Started with this prompt" → "Iterated through N turns" → "Shipped this"
- PM work framed as "took X from state A to state B" with visual deltas
- Hover states reveal the conversation that drove each change

### Why It Signals Sophistication
Emphasizes iteration over magic. Shows you understand that good output comes from good process, not just good prompts.

## 3. The Annotated Transcript

The site is structured as a long-form document with marginalia—like a technical paper or annotated code. Main column tells your story; margins show the meta-layer of *how* you work.

### Key Elements
- Clean, readable main content (PM accomplishments, project descriptions)
- Right margin contains: tool calls made, prompts used, lessons learned, "what I'd do differently"
- Collapsible annotation layers (toggle between "just the story" and "show the work")
- Footnote-style links to actual Claude Code conversation exports
- Typography inspired by technical documentation (Stripe docs meets academic papers)

### Why It Signals Sophistication
You're teaching, not just showing. Positions you as someone who thinks about *why* things work, not just *that* they work.

## 4. The Workbench

A multi-pane interface like an IDE or dev tools. Different "panels" show different aspects—PM work, vibe coding projects, writing, background. Visitors can resize, collapse, rearrange.

### Key Elements
- Persistent sidebar with "file tree" of experience/projects
- Main panel shows selected content
- Secondary panels can show: related projects, skills used, tools employed
- Terminal panel at bottom that's actually functional (easter eggs, maybe a simple chatbot)
- Tabs for different "workspaces": Product Management, Vibe Coding, Marketing/GTM

### Why It Signals Sophistication
You've internalized the tools of technical work. The interface IS the message—you think in systems.

## 5. The Collaboration Log

Frame entire career and project portfolio as a series of collaborations—with teams, with customers, and now with AI. Visual language is commit log / activity feed / conversation thread.

### Key Elements
- Timeline-based navigation (not boring resume timeline—more like GitHub contribution graph)
- Each entry is a "collaboration": who, what, outcome, artifacts
- Vibe coding projects explicitly show the human-AI collaboration structure
- Pull quotes from actual conversations (testimonials, reactions)
- Visual distinction between human contributions and AI contributions in projects

### Why It Signals Sophistication
You're not positioning AI as a replacement for skill—you're showing it as a new kind of collaboration partner. The sophistication is in *how* you collaborate.

## Cross-Cutting Elements

Regardless of direction, these details signal "advanced vibe coder":

| Signal | What it communicates |
|--------|---------------------|
| Show actual prompts | Prompting is a skill, not magic |
| Show iteration count | First drafts are rarely shippable |
| Show tool use | Uses Claude Code's full capability, not just chat |
| Link to repos | Not hiding the code |
| Discuss what didn't work | Has judgment about when AI helps vs. doesn't |
| Custom skills / MCP servers | Extended the toolchain |

## Vibe Coding Project Framing

For each project, structure as:

1. **The Problem:** What I was trying to solve
2. **Why Vibe Coding:** Why this was a good fit for AI-assisted development
3. **The Approach:** Key prompting strategies, tool use, iteration patterns
4. **The Judgment Calls:** Where I steered, where I let Claude run
5. **The Output:** What shipped, with links
6. **The Lessons:** What I learned about working this way
