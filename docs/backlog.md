# Website Redesign Backlog

## How I Work Page — Content & Format
- Diff format compressed content into short platitudes — need to restore specificity and detail for credibility while keeping it scannable
- Too many diffs back-to-back is hard to follow — needs visual variety to break up the page
- Consider: diffs mixed with terminal output and prompts (like a Claude session) to create rhythm
- Consider: sections that are "compacted" by default but expandable for detail
- Balance: short enough to skim, specific enough to be credible

## Navigation & Information Architecture
- How I Work could become "skills/" with each section as a subpage in the left nav
- Follow the literal structure of Claude skills: `skillname/skills.md` + helper files
- This would let each topic (customer intimacy, cross-functional leadership, etc.) breathe on its own page instead of competing for space on one long scroll

## New Sections / Rename Ideas
- Add a "skills" section (possibly replacing or restructuring How I Work)
- Reviews could be renamed "agents" to stay in the IDE metaphor
- Add GitHub links somewhere prominent

## Let's Work Together Page
- Current CONTRIBUTING.md page needs formatting rethink to align with the IDE/diff theme
- Consulting cards feel like a different design language from the rest of the site

## Mobile Responsiveness
- Splash screen: ASCII art grid too wide on mobile — needs to scale down or reflow for narrow viewports
- Main site: navigation (sidebar file tree) needs mobile-friendly treatment — hamburger menu, drawer, or alternative pattern

## General
- Add links to GitHub profile/repos
