## PM Experience 2025

### Summary

In 2025, I was the lynchpin in taking R-Zero's most important strategic initiative from theory to deployment to proof of value. I did this while simultaneously stepping up to lead marketing during a leadership vacuum, and pioneering AI adoption across the company. My approach throughout was simple: fearlessly do whatever it takes to make the product successful.

### 1. Took ODCV from Theory to Proven Value

At the start of 2025, we had one potential ODCV project and no expertise. I stepped up:
- Technical sales support
- Became the ODCV expert
- Built the tools to prove it works—dashboards, SOO calculators, SOO generators—when Engineering was moving slowly

**Key quote:** Forrest's response to the Stanford dashboard: "THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME."

More importantly, by showing performance and MSI misprogramming clearly, we built confidence with a skeptical facility leader, leading to a public case study and expansion conversations.

I translated a general concept of ODCV and made it work on the ground in very different customer environments—Stanford Children's Hospital, Qualcomm, Brandywine. This meant building:
- Executive dashboards and daily reports for Stanford and Qualcomm, including the core code for the savings calculations
- SOO calculators (interactive tools showing how OA savings works)
- SOO generators (given mechanicals, what should the SOO be?)

### 2. Pointed the Way to R-Zero's Future as a Data-Driven Company

As we started gathering building data I proved the feasibility on future moonshots for a data-driven software platform future:
- Continuous commissioning
- Probabilistic fault detection and diagnostics
- Autonomous functional performance testing

### 3. Pioneered AI Adoption as a Cultural Example

Demonstrated AI acceleration across software development, messaging, competitive intelligence, and sales enablement.

**Key quote:** Alex publicly recognized the Competitive Intelligence tool I built in a weekend, calling it "great potential to accelerate our strategic and GTM efforts."

### 4. Led Marketing Through a Critical Transition

While maintaining PM responsibilities, led marketing during a leadership vacuum:
- Pivoted effort to solve critical pain point of moving specific customer conversation to pilot. Built AI content pipeline turning customer objections expressed on calls into targeted blog posts addressing those exact objections. Result: 6 posts in 4 weeks.
- Overhauled company messaging in Spring 2025. That work became the foundation for another iteration in Fall 2025; Alex called my competitive differentiation section "very well done and a significant improvement."

### 5. Earned Trust Across the Organization

Throughout 2025, built trust across the organization—from CEO visibility on pilot updates, to GTM partnership with Elizabeth's team, to Engineering collaboration with David.

**Key quote:** Thomas Reznik: "an incredible teammate... truly leads by example."

### The Meta-Point

2025 demonstrated I rapidly evolve to do what's right for the business—leading marketing as a PM, building software with no dev background, becoming the ODCV expert when we had none. This is product management: do whatever it takes. I was the primary driver who delivered R-Zero's most important initiative from theory to proof of value.

## PM Experience 2024

### Feature Launches
Pivotal role in scoping and delivering complex builds, notably EEC and IAQ Dashboard (both owned from concept to launch).

### Product Strategy
Instrumental in shaping R-Zero's shift toward energy efficiency, particularly work evaluating opportunity / developing roadmap for EaaS. Leadership in needs discovery for EEC, despite challenges in securing customer meetings.

### Pilot Development
Successfully revitalized the ODCV pilot program, securing four active customer prospects and accelerating technical scoping.

### Process Improvement
Led enhancements in Product-to-Eng project handoff, CSM pilot customer recruitment, and GTM training on major upcoming releases.

## Vibe Coding Framing

Want to highlight not just what I did, but why and how. Want to communicate that I'm not fly-by-night with a basic approach but am pretty advanced for a non-engineer.

### Key Messages to Convey
- Deep understanding of the tool, not just surface-level usage
- Iteration and judgment, not just prompt-and-pray
- Built production systems, not just demos
- Extended the toolchain (custom skills, workflows)
- Can articulate *why* certain approaches work

### Projects to Highlight
(To be populated with specific projects, prompts, and lessons learned)
